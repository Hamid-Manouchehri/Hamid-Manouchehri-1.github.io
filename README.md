This is <i>Hamid Manouchehri</i>. I have a bachelor's degree in <u>electrical engineering</u> (control engineering) and a master's degree in <u>mechatronics engineering</u> from the University of Tehran. During my academic experience, I was able to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to conduct research in the field of robotics. <br>

After completing my master's thesis on simulating bimanual manipulation using two UR5 manipulators (<a href="https://hamid-manouchehri.github.io/Development-and-Simulation-of-Bimanual-Object-Manipulation/">link</a>), I now have a comprehensive understanding of simulation, dynamic modeling, kinematics, control, algorithms and planning. I have also had the opportunity to work as part of a team and learn the necessary soft skills. What I really like about robotics is the close intersection between theorical formulation and experimental validation.
