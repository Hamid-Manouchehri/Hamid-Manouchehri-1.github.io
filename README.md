This is __Hamid Manouchehri__. I am a robotic reseracher who is intereseted in making intelligent practical robots with hands and legs to serve human. 
I do not consider myself a software nor hardware engineer, rather I'd like to be specialized in combination of software and hardware merely related to robots or more broadly mechatronics systems. I am keen to be involved in projects mostly related to design and control of motion, manipulation and perception of a robot. It's my vision to be an expert in __ROS__ (Robot Operating System) and develop it to be a separate independet operating system for every single robot.

Currently I'm doing my master thesis about bi-manual manipulation of an upper limb robot with the title of __"A Model-based Control System for Bi-manual Manipulation"__ by supervision of Dr. [Mohammad Shahbazi](https://mech.iust.ac.ir/en/faculty/dr-mohammad-shahbazi/) and Dr. [Bahram Tarvirdizadeh](https://profile.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahram). It is simulation of an object manipulation by a bi-manual robot in <b>Gazebo</b> that computes inverse dynamics of both arms with a closed-loop force controller. I will finish my master's program this semester.
