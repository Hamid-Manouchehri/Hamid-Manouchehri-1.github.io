This is <b>Hamid Manouchehri</b>. I am a robotic reseracher who is intereseted in making intelligent practical robots
with hands and legs to serve human. 
I do not consider myself a software nor hardware engineer, 
rather I'd like to be specialized in combination of software and hardware merely related to robots
or more broadly mechatronics systems. 
I am keen to be involved in projects mostly related to design and control of motion,
manipulation and perception of a robot.
It's my vision to be an expert in <b>ROS</b> (Robot Operating System) and 
develop it to be a separate independet operating system for every single robot.

Currently I'm doing my master thesis about bi-manual manipulation of an upper limb robot
with the title of <b>"A Model-based Control System for Bi-manual Manipulation"</b> 
by supervision of Dr. <a href="https://mech.iust.ac.ir/en/faculty/dr-mohammad-shahbazi/">Mohammad Shahbazi</a> and 
Dr. <a href="https://profile.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahram">Bahram Tarvirdizadeh</a>. 
It is simulation of an object manipulation by a bi-manual robot in <b>Gazebo</b> that
computes inverse dynamics of both arms with a closed-loop force controller. I will finish my master's program this semester.
