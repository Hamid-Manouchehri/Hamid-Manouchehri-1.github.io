This is <b>Hamid Manouchehri</b>. I have bachelor's degree in <b>Electrical Engineering</b> (Control) and master's degree in <b>Mechatronics Engineering</b>. During my academic experiences, I gained the vision to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to do research in the field of robotics. <br>
After doing my master's thesis on simulation of <b>bimanual manipulation</b> using two UR5 manipulators (<a href="https://hamid-manouchehri.github.io/Development-and-Simulation-of-Bimanual-Object-Manipulation/">link</a>), I now have a great understanding of simulation, dynamics, kinematics, control, algorithms and open source paltforms like ROS, Gazebo, MOVEit. Also, I had the opportunity to work as a part of a team and learn the required soft skills and teamwork tool such as <b>GitHub</b>. Moreover, I have the tendency and enthusiasm to embark on new directions of robotics. <br>
My interests: <br>
  * (mobile) manipulator <br>
  * locomotion <br>
  * robot learning <br>
  * visual servoing
