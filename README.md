This is <b>Hamid Manouchehri</b>. I have bachelor's degree in <b>Electrical Engineering</b> (Control) and master's degree in <b>Mechatronics Engineering</b> from University of Tehran. During my academic experiences, I could gain the vision to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to do research in the field of robotics. <br>
After doing my master's thesis on simulation of <b>bimanual manipulation</b> using two UR5 manipulators (<a href="https://hamid-manouchehri.github.io/Development-and-Simulation-of-Bimanual-Object-Manipulation/">link</a>), I now have a great understanding of <u> simulation </u>, <u>dynamics</u>, <u>kinematics</u>, <u>control</u>, <u>algorithms</u> and <u>open-source</u> paltforms like <u>ROS</u>, <u>Gazebo</u>, <u>MOVEit</u>. Also, I had the opportunity to work as a part of a team and learn the required soft skills and teamwork tool such as <u>GitHub</u>. Moreover, I have the tendency and enthusiasm to embark on new directions of robotics. <br><br>
