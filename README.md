This is <b>Hamid Manouchehri</b>. I am a robotic reseracher who is intereseted in making intelligent practical robots with hands and legs to serve human. 
I do not consider myself a software nor hardware engineer, rather I'd like to be specialized in combination of software and hardware merely related to robots or more broadly mechatronics systems. I am keen to be involved in projects mostly related to design and control of <b>motion</b>, <b>manipulation</b> and <b>perception</b> of a robot. It's my vision to be an expert in <b>ROS</b> (Robot Operating System) and develop it to be a separate independet operating system for every single robot.
<br><br>

Currently I'm doing my master thesis about bi-manual manipulation of an upper limb robot with the title of <b>"A Model-based Control System for Bi-manual Object Manipulation"</b> by supervision of Dr. <a href="https://mech.iust.ac.ir/en/faculty/dr-mohammad-shahbazi/"> Mohammad Shahbazi </a> and Dr. <a href="https://profile.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahram"> Bahram Tarvirdizadeh </a>. It is simulation of an object manipulation by a bi-manual robot in <b>Gazebo</b> that computes inverse dynamics of both arms with a closed-loop force controller. I have finished my master's program on Feb 12 in 2023.
