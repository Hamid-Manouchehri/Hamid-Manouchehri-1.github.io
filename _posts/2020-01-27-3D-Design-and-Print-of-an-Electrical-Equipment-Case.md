### Overview

For some electrical devices that I was working on, we needed a package to hold all belongings including, antenna, battery, a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) 3, and etc. It was hard to locate the components in a way to prevent signal interference, maximum heat dissipation without internal fan or heat sink, and haveing the minimum size/empty space.

### Project Definition

At first, I measured the geometric parameters of the components by a [calipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers). For some components like _Raspberry Pi_, it was hard to measure its sub-modules, so I used its 3D CAD model, also all of the specifications of _Raspberry Pi_ is mentioned in its datasheet. Finally I designed its CAD model via __Solidworks__ and exported _.STL_ file for a _3D printer_.
