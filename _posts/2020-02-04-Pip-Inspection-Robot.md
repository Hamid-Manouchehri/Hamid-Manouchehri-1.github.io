### Overview

During the course of `Mechatronics 1`, our [lecturer](https://profile.ut.ac.ir/en/~hrhadi/courses) asked us to design and implement a mechanism for a __pip inspection mobile robot__ to make it able to traverse a vertical path inside a pip of certain diameter. For that purpose I chose __scissors mechanism__, equiped with a wheel. It will be mounted on the top of a four wheel mobile robot (the total structure was designed from the scratch in Solidworks) and actuates (expands) whenever the robot wants to go through a vertical path. The mechanism would generate proper friction for wheels to prevent slipping.
