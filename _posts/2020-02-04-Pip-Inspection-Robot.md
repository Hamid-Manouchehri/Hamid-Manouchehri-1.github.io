### Overview

During the course of `Mechatronics 1`, our [lecturer](https://profile.ut.ac.ir/en/~hrhadi/courses) asked us to design and implement a mechanism for a __pip inspection mobile robot__ to make it able to traverse a vertical path inside a pip of certain diameter, between 4.2" and 5". For that purpose I chose [__scissors mechanism__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scissors_mechanism), equiped with a wheel, the original _CAD model_ was taken from [grabcad](https://grabcad.com/library). It will be mounted on the top of a four wheel mobile robot (the total structure was designed from the scratch in Solidworks) and actuates (expands) whenever the robot wants to go through a vertical path. The mechanism would generate proper friction for wheels to prevent slipping. .The primary porpuse of choosing this mechanism is _simplicity_ besides _efficiency_.
