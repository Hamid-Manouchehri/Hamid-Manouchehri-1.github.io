### Overview

[__Genetic Algorithm__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) (GA) is a _metahuristic_ algorithm inspired by the process of __natural selection__ which is an __evolutionary algorithm__ (EA). It is mostly used for _oprimization_ and _serach_ problems. During the course of __Bio-Inspired Computing__, I could solve an optimization problem by GA. The algorithms consists of different steps based on what is happening in _Gens_ of biological creatures.
