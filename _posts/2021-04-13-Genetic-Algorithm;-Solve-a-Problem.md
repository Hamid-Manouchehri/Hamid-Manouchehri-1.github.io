### Overview

[__Genetic Algorithm__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) (GA) is a _metahuristic_ algorithm inspired by the process of __natural selection__, which is an __evolutionary algorithm__ (EA). It is mostly used for _optimization_ and _search_ problems. During the course of __Bio-Inspired Computing__, I could solve an optimization problem by GA. The algorithm consists of different steps based on what is happening in _Gens_ of biological creatures. According to the stochastic nature of GA, firstly we have to _model_ the problem, chose a genetic representation, then design a _fitness function_, after that, build a _population_, next choose a _selection_, _recombination_, and _mutation_ sequentially. Finally, devise a _termination condition_ and analysis procedure.
