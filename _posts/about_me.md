### about me

This is __Hamid Manouchehri__. I am a robotic reseracher who is intereseted in making intelligent practical robots with hands and legs to serve human. I do not consider myself a software nor hardware engineer, rather I'd like to be specialized in combination of software and hardware merely related to robots or more broadly mechatronics systems.I am keen to be involved in projects mostly related to design and control of _motion_, _manipulation_ and _perception_ of a robot. It's my vision to be an expert in __ROS__ (Robot Operating System) and develop it to be a separate independet operating system for every single robots.

Currently I'm doing my master thesis about bi-manual manipulation of an upper limb robot with the title of "A Model-based Control System for Bi-manual Manipulation" by supervision of Dr. [Mohammad Shahbazi] and Dr. [Bahram Tarvirdizadeh]. It is simulation of a manipulation of an object by a bi-manual robot in __Gazebo__ that compute inverse dynamics of both arms with a force controller. I will finish my master's program this semester.
