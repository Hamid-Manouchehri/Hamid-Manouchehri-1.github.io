### about me

This is __Hamid Manouchehri__. I am a robotic reseracher who is intereseted in making intelligent practical robots with hands and legs to serve human. I do not consider myself a software nor hardware engineer, rather I like it to be specialized in software and hardware merely related to robots or more broadly mechatronics systems.I am keen to be involved in projects mostly related to _motion_, _manipulation_ and _perception_ of the robot.
