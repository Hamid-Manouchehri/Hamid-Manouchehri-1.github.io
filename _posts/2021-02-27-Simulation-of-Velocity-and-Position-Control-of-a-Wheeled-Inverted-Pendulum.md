within the course of __Nonlinear Control__, I was intended to simulate the result of [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1435497), __"Velocity and Position Control of a Wheeled Inverted Pendulum by Partial Feedback Linearization"__, via _MATLAB_. Considering the inverted pendulum is an _underactuated system_, it is demanding to control such a _non-linear_ underactuated system, because there are less controllabe states than total states of the system.
