As a part of my master's thesis, for implementing inverse dynamics algorithm to an upper-body bi-manual robot base on my supervisor [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320330613_Inverse_Dynamics_Control_of_Bimanual_Object_Manipulation_Using_Orthogonal_Decomposition_An_Analytic_Approach) in a 3D simulator, I had to work with __Gazebo__. First the [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) model of the robot was prepared by the help of my teammate, Ms [Nooshin Kohli](https://github.com/nooshin-kohli), then other dependencies like torque controllers of joints, launch file, and etc attached, finally of courese the script of algorithm was written by a great deal of work.
