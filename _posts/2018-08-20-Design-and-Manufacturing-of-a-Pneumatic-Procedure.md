### Overview

My _B.Sc._ thesis was design and manufacturing of a [__pneumatic__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics) table for illustrating some concepts of pneumatic applications for __instrumentation laboratory__ with my teammate, _Eng. Yadollah Alinaghi Naini_ under supervision of Dr. [Mohsen Shafieirad](https://faculty.kashanu.ac.ir/mshafieirad/en). The project was defined in a way to illustrate different structures and sensors of air pressure measurement and how pneumatic (/electro-pneumatic) actuators work through different _test scenarios_. Firstly, we desinged and simulated the scanarios by [FluidSIM](https://www.festo.com/in/en/e/technical-education/digital-learning/virtual-simulation-and-modelling-id_31275/) software. Then draw a schematic (/map) for placement  of pneumatic facilities. After that, we did _actuator sizing_ to provide a suitable pneumatic equipments for the scenarios.
