### Overview

My _B.Sc._ thesis was design and manufacturing of a [__pneumatic__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics) table for illustrating some concepts of pneumatic applications for __instrumentation laboratory__ with my teammate, _Eng. Yadollah Alinaghi Naini_ under supervision of Dr. [Mohsen Shafieirad](https://faculty.kashanu.ac.ir/mshafieirad/en). The project was defined in a way to illustrate different structures and sensors for measurement of air pressure and how pneumatic (/electro-pneumatic) actuators work through different _test scenarios_. Firstly, we _desinged and simulated_ the scanarios by [FluidSIM](https://www.festo.com/in/en/e/technical-education/digital-learning/virtual-simulation-and-modelling-id_31275/) software. Then draw a _schematic_ (/map) for placement of pneumatic facilities. After that, we did _actuator sizing_ to provide suitable pneumatic equipments for the scenarios.

### Familiarity with Equipments

According to _Fig. 1_:
1. Panel for activation of the _test scenarios_
2. _2 Position 5 Way Soleniod Valve_, directional control valve
3. _Two Finger Double Action Pneumatic Gripper_, parallel gripping type, actuates via _#5_
4. _Magnetic Linear Slide (Actuator)_
5. _3 Position 5 Way Flow Control Valve_, hand lever operated
6. _Pneumatic Cylinder_
7. _Air Filter and Pressure Regulator Gauge_
8. _Pneumatic Cylinder_, equipped with magnetic proximity sensor
9. Main _Air Distribution Valve_, connects to the compressor
10. _T Shape Hose Tube Connector_
11. _Pneumatic Shut-off Valve_
12. _Differential Pressure Transmitter_

In addition to the _Differential Pressure Transmitter_, we had [mercury pressure gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_pressure_gauge) and _piezoresistive transducer_ ([MPX5100DP](https://www.nxp.com/part/MPX5100DP#/)) to measure different types of pressures, including _absolute pressure_, _gauge pressure_, and _differential pressure_. For _MXP5100DP_, we designed our _PCB_ based on its datasheet in the laboratory.
