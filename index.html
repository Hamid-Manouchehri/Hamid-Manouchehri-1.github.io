              This is <b>Hamid Manouchehri</b>. I am a robotic reseracher who is intereseted in making intelligent practical robots
              with hands and legs to serve human. 
              I do not consider myself a software nor hardware engineer, 
              rather I'd like to be specialized in combination of software and hardware merely related to robots
              or more broadly mechatronics systems. 
              I am keen to be involved in projects mostly related to design and control of motion,
              manipulation and perception of a robot.
              It's my vision to be an expert in <b>ROS</b> (Robot Operating System) and 
              develop it to be a separate independet operating system for every single robots.
              <br><br>
            
              Currently I'm doing my master thesis about bi-manual manipulation of an upper limb robot
              with the title of <b>"A Model-based Control System for Bi-manual Manipulation"</b> 
              by supervision of Dr.<a href="https://mech.iust.ac.ir/en/faculty/dr-mohammad-shahbazi/">Mohammad Shahbazi</a> and 
              Dr.<a href="https://profile.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahram">Bahram Tarvirdizadeh</a>. 
              It is simulation of a manipulation of an object by a bi-manual robot in <b>Gazebo</b> that
              computes inverse dynamics of both arms with a force controller. I will finish my master's program this semester.
