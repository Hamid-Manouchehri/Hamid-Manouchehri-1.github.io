### Some notification for later modification of the Blog:

1. Know hierarchy of files: <br>
   `_config.yml` ------------> configure sidebar panel and reference links <br> 
   `Hamid Manouchehri` tab ------------> `README.md` <br>
   `Projects` tab ------------> `projects.html` ------------> `_posts/` 
2. Considering loading commits takes time, wait for some minutes to see output of your modification in your Blog. Frequent commits may lead you to make the mistake of that some changes does not work, or you have something wrong with the code, whereas, there is nothing wrong, but previous change have not been deployed yet.
3. Right caption: `Fig. 1`  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Wrong caption: `Fig.1`
4. Crop images with minimum border to have become more suitable in terms of vertical margins in webpages.
5. Do not add comment to `projects.html` and `archive.html`, otherwise it makes problem to load including sources.
6. Do not change `_posts/` files into `html`, it is easier to work with [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) syntax and even it supports `html`.
7. Sometimes page `refresh` does not function, to see the changes of commits, so it is a good idea to close the tab and open it again: <br>
   `setting` > `pages` > link of the blog
